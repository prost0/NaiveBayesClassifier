Given a `DateTime` representing a person's birthday, how do I calculate their
age?

When setting a form's opacity should I use a decimal or double?
I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity.

This is my code:

    
    
    decimal trans = trackBar1.Value / 5000;
    this.Opacity = trans;
    

When I try to build it, I get this error:

> Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'.

I tried making `trans` a `double`, but then the control doesn't work. This
code has worked fine for me in VB.NET in the past.

Why doesn't the percentage width child in absolutely positioned parent work?


I have an absolutely positioned `div` containing several children, one of
which is a relatively positioned `div`. When I use a **percentage-based
width** on the child `div`, it collapses to `0` width on IE7, but not on
Firefox or Safari.

If I use **pixel width**, it works. If the parent is relatively positioned,
the percentage width on the child works.

Is there something I'm missing here? Is there an easy fix for this besides the
_pixel-based width_ on the child? Is there an area of the `CSS` specification
that covers this?
