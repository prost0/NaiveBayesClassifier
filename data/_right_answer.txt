 Is Jagermeister healthy for you?
 I always heard that Jagermeister is very healthy for you and is a great digestive ,
 is all this true?
 Would a shot of Jagermeister make me more healthier or would the alcohol just be damaging me in time?
 This is my first question on this site so sorry if I didn't formulated it quite

Just wondering how a bottle conditioned beer will change over its life - if at all? 
And is there a perfect time to drink one? Also do different types change differently?

How to know which wine goes with which type of food
I'm planning on having some friends over next week, and since I really enjoy grilling I plan to make 
some good steaks for them. They like wines, I personally would just drink a cold beer considering the 
heat of the grilling and that we reach high temperatures this time of the year. 
And well the issue is that I know nothing about wines and how to combine them with different meals. 
But for the sake of not having a too broad question,
 I'd like to know which wine could go best with a steak and why.

Is beer healthy if drunk in moderation?
Beer is obviously not healthy if it is drunk to much, however, one of my friends argue a little beer 
in moderation can provide certain health benefits. Like it can lower risk of stroke and heart 
diseases. Is this true or is it just baloney people say to get someone else to drink a little 
bit? Are these claims true?

I've read that raw hops can be bad for dogs, somehow causing hyperthermia.
 What about very hoppy beers? 
 Answers might include reports on what it is in hops (alpha acids?) that make hops bad for dogs.
 Please keep answers restricted to the effect of brewed hops. 
 I already realize the fermented alcohol can be bad for smaller pets.
  I'm not looking for alcohol related answers, just answers on boiled and fermented hops.
  As an aside, it seems okay for cats. Mine decided to take a sip, seemed to like it,
   and came back for more.

Background: I was drinking a New Belgium;
last week and thinking about the hops that I was tasting in the finish.
For me, hops in general were a pretty slowly acquired taste,
 and I didn't start truly appreciating the hoppy West Coast style until
 I encountered Sierra Nevada Torpedo; and fell in love.
 Now I finally find myself wanting to get to know specific varieties of hops by flavor and scent.
 Amarillo, Cascade, and so on - I know there are dozens and dozens of varieties, 
 but how do I start training myself to recognize their differences 
 (and identify the most common varieties) in the drink itself? 
 Should I buy some hops from a supply store, 
 and huff 'em like a soccer mom in a fabric softener commercial?
  Or would that be totally different from what comes through in a beer? 
  Would it be better to find a stool at a local brewery/brewpub and ask for a lesson in liquid form?
